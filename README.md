This KYC Photo Comparison API is developed using Flask and Flask-RESTx, providing an endpoint for comparing two photos to verify user identity for KYC (Know Your Customer) purposes.

## Features
- Upload and compare two photos: an ID photo and a user photo.
- Utilizes face recognition to determine if the photos belong to the same person.
- Returns the match result and similarity percentage.

## Installation

To run this API, you will need Python installed on your system. After cloning the repository, you can install the required dependencies by running:

`bash
pip install flask flask-restx face_recognition numpy
`

## Usage

To use the API, you need to send a `POST` request to the `/compare-photos` endpoint with multipart/form-data containing the two photos to be compared. Here is an example `curl` command to do this:

`curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/compare-photos \
  -F "id_photo=@/path/to/id_photo.jpg" \
  -F "user_photo=@/path/to/user_photo.jpg"` 

Replace `/path/to/id_photo.jpg` and `/path/to/user_photo.jpg` with the actual paths to your images.

## Response

The response will be a JSON object that includes:

-   `match`: A boolean indicating whether the faces in the two photos match.
-   `similarity_percentage`: A percentage indicating how similar the faces are.

Example of a successful response:

Copy code

`{
  "match": true,
  "similarity_percentage": 92.5
}` 

## Notes

-   Ensure that the images are in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format.
-   The API is set to run in debug mode for development purposes. For production, ensure to set `debug` to `False`.
